Here’s a small sample of the things that really pique my interest: data, statistics, machine learning, R, Python, modeling, visualization, problem solving, mathematics, and programming. I am constantly working to improve my abilities in these areas. Even when I am away from a computer, they consume my thoughts. When I graduate in May, I hope to find myself in a career where I can apply all of these skills on a regular basis to answer meaningful questions. Right now, I hope the content of this site conveys the intensity of my passion for these topics.

When I do step away from it all, I try to spend my time outdoors. The national parks have a special place in my heart; a life goal of mine is to someday climb the face of El Capitan, but I would be happy finishing any big wall in Yosemite.

I enjoy talking with people about these things (as well other nerdy things like Doctor Who), and I love hearing what others are interested in. Feel free to reach out to me via any of the links in the footer. Thanks!
